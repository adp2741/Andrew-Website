                        <li>Automated work using parallel processing and subprocessing in Python.</li>
                        <li>Used R Statistics with Python (RPy2) for automated DEM smoothing using 2d wavelets.</li>
                        <li>Worked with GRIB2 data from NOAA. Fortran was originally used for data extraction which I then converted to Python and C. Python was used to FTP to the site for data acquisition and C to write data to a SQLite database.</li>
                        <li>Used C-Types in Python to access C .dll to allow for Python script to run seamlessly.</li>
                        <li>Used NetCDF C Library to read and write and perform calculations on NetCDF hourly files. The result was a file holding hourly data for 31 years for the entire globe. The C tool allowed the user to query by location and by number of years.</li>
                        <li>Due to ArcGIS' lack of a necessary tool, I created a C# application to create points and cross sections along river shapefiles by specifying distances between points and cross sections as well as the length of the cross sections.</li>
                        <li>Implemented ArcObjects to create simple ArcGIS plugins for ArcMap, such as a button that converts all raster data currently open on the map to the same color scheme.</li>
